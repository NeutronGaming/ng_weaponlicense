# üî´ NG Weapon License System #

A comprehensive weapon license management system for FiveM ESX servers with application processing,
exam system, police management tools, and advanced license verification features.

## Disclaimer
Any of my free releases are scripts I have made for my server and decided to distribute for free! I am happy to collaberate with any other creators on upcoming projects as I have many more in the works! Tebex and Discord for support and more free releases coming soon!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Database Setup
The script automatically creates the required database tables (make sure to restart again after ensuring to make sure the database properly inputs):
- `weapon_license_applications` - Pending applications
- `weapon_license_accepted` - Approved applications awaiting exam
- `weapon_license_bans` - Banned players
- `weapon_licenses` - License records with strike tracking

### 2. Item Installation
Add this item to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` & the item image to your `ox_inventory/web/images/`

```lua
['weaponlicense'] = {
    label = 'Weapon License',
    weight = 10,
    stack = false,
    close = true,
    description = 'Official weapon license',
    client = {
        export = 'ng_weaponlicense.useWeaponLicense'
    }
}
```

### 3. Configuration
Edit `config.lua` to your liking (all locations and costs are preconfigured to be drag and drop but feel free to change them!)

### 4. File Installation
1. Download and extract the script to your resources folder
2. Add `ensure ng_weaponlicense` to your server.cfg

## üîÑ Updates

I DO NOT WORK ON QBCORE CURRENTLY! I WORK ON ESX FRAMWORK ONLY IF YOU NEED THIS CONVERTED TO QBCORE YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT FOR YOU. I CANNOT TEST QBCORE PROPERLY AS I DONT HAVE A TEST SERVER SETUP FOR IT YET. In the future on my paid releases I plan to make them for both frameworks! Sorry for any inconvenience!
Any updates will be uploaded to github as I make them. Enjoy!
